# Connection Workflow Test - Native tldraw Integration

## Implementation Summary

Integrated connection handles with tldraw's native arrow tool for seamless component connections:

### Features Implemented

1. **Connection Handles**: Added handles to all four sides (top, right, bottom, left) of infrastructure components
2. **Native Arrow Integration**: Uses tldraw's built-in arrow tool with handle binding
3. **Automatic Snapping**: Arrows automatically snap to component handles
4. **Standard Workflow**: Follows tldraw's standard arrow drawing conventions

### How to Test

1. **Select Arrow Tool**:
   - Press `A` key or select arrow tool from tldraw's toolbar
   - No custom "Connect" button needed

2. **Create Connections**:
   - Click on a component to see its blue connection handles
   - Click and drag from one component's handle to another component's handle
   - Arrow automatically snaps to handles and creates connection

3. **Switch Tools**:
   - Press `V` to switch back to select tool
   - Press `A` to use arrow tool again

### Technical Details

#### Handle System Integration
- Added `getHandles()` method to `BaseInfraShapeUtil` class
- Each component exposes 4 handles: top, right, bottom, left
- Handles have `canBind: true` and `canSnap: true` for arrow connections
- Uses tldraw's native handle binding system

#### Native Arrow Integration
- Removed custom connection mode and event handling
- Uses tldraw's built-in arrow tool functionality
- Arrows automatically bind to component handles
- Standard tldraw arrow editing features work (bend points, styling, etc.)

#### Files Modified
- `shapes/base.tsx`: Added `getHandles()` method to all infrastructure shapes
- `canvas.tsx`: Removed custom connection logic
- `toolbar.tsx`: Removed Connect button
- `connection-guide.tsx`: Updated instructions for native workflow

### Component Compatibility
- Works with all infrastructure component types (compute, database, storage, etc.)
- Respects container relationships (VPCs, subnets, availability zones)
- Arrows can connect between any component types

### Visual Styling
- Handles appear when components are selected
- Blue color scheme for consistency with app theme
- Glass morphism styling for connection mode indicator
- Animated pulse indicator during connection process
