# Arrow Binding Test Guide

## 🔧 **Issue Fixed**

The problem was that infrastructure components weren't properly configured for arrow binding in tldraw v3.

### **Root Cause**
- Missing `canBind = () => true` method in base shape class
- Custom handles were unnecessary and potentially conflicting with native arrow system
- Container shapes correctly disable binding, but regular shapes needed explicit binding enabled

### **Solution Applied**
1. ✅ Removed custom handle implementation that was causing conflicts
2. ✅ Added `canBind = () => true` to BaseInfraShapeUtil
3. ✅ Container shapes (VPC, Subnet, AZ) keep `canBind = () => false`
4. ✅ Regular components (compute, database, storage) now support arrow binding

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Step 1: Add Components**
1. Drag some regular components onto canvas:
   - Compute instances
   - Database components  
   - Storage components
   - External systems
   - Users

### **Step 2: Test Arrow Tool**
1. Press `A` to activate arrow tool
2. Try to draw arrows between components
3. **Expected**: Arrows should connect to component edges
4. **Expected**: Arrows should snap to component boundaries

### **Step 3: Test Container Behavior**
1. Add container components (VPC, Subnet, AZ)
2. Try to connect arrows to containers
3. **Expected**: Containers should NOT accept arrow connections
4. **Expected**: Only regular components accept arrows

### **Step 4: Test Arrow Features**
1. Create some arrow connections
2. Move components around
3. **Expected**: Arrows stay connected and follow components
4. Double-click arrows to add bend points
5. **Expected**: Standard tldraw arrow editing works

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

✅ Press `A` to activate arrow tool  
✅ Draw arrows between regular components (compute, database, storage)  
✅ Arrows snap to component edges automatically  
✅ Moving components keeps arrows connected  
✅ Container shapes (VPC, Subnet, AZ) reject arrow connections  
✅ Standard arrow editing features work (bend points, styling)  

## 🔍 **What Changed**

### **Before (Broken)**
```typescript
// Had custom handles that conflicted with native system
override getHandles(shape: T): TLHandle[] {
    return [/* complex custom handles */];
}
// Missing canBind method
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```typescript
// Enable arrow binding for infrastructure components
override canBind = () => {
    // Only allow binding for non-container shapes
    // Container shapes (VPC, Subnet, AZ) override this to return false
    return true;
}
// No custom handles - use native tldraw arrow system
```

## 🚀 **Technical Notes**

- **tldraw v3.13.1**: Uses native arrow binding system
- **BaseBoxShapeUtil**: Provides base arrow binding functionality
- **canBind()**: Controls whether arrows can connect to shapes
- **No Custom Handles**: tldraw handles arrow connections automatically
- **Container Logic**: Containers disable binding for cleaner diagrams
