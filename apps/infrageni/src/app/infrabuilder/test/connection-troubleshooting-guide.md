# Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Event Listener Recreation Bug** ✅
- **Problem**: Event listener was being removed/re-added every time connection state changed
- **Fix**: Removed `connectionState` from useEffect dependencies
- **Result**: Stable event listener that doesn't get destroyed during connection process

### 2. **Shape Detection API Issue** ✅  
- **Problem**: `editor.getShapeAtPoint()` might not exist or work as expected
- **Fix**: Manual shape hit detection by iterating through all shapes and checking bounds
- **Result**: Reliable shape detection with clear console logging

### 3. **Missing Debug Information** ✅
- **Problem**: No visibility into what was happening during connection attempts
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive console logging throughout the workflow
- **Result**: Full visibility into connection process with emoji-coded messages

### 4. **State Management Issues** ✅
- **Problem**: Stale closure problems with connection state
- **Fix**: Used functional state updates with `prevState => newState` pattern
- **Result**: Reliable state updates that always use current state

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Enable Debug Mode
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Start the application

### Step 2: Test Connection Mode
1. Click "Connect" button in toolbar
2. **Expected**: Console shows "👂 Added connection event listener"
3. **Expected**: Blue indicator appears: "Connection Mode: Click component edges to connect"

### Step 3: Test Shape Detection
1. Drag some components onto canvas
2. In connect mode, click on a component
3. **Expected Console Output**:
   ```
   🎯 Pointer down in connect mode
   📍 Click point: {x: xxx, y: xxx}
   ✅ Hit shape: shape_id compute
   📐 Relative position: {relativeX: xx, relativeY: xx, w: 120, h: 80}
   🎯 Detected handle: top/right/bottom/left
   🔄 Current connection state: {isConnecting: false}
   🆕 Starting new connection
   ```

### Step 4: Test Connection Completion  
1. After starting a connection, click near the edge of another component
2. **Expected Console Output**:
   ```
   🎯 Pointer down in connect mode
   📍 Click point: {x: xxx, y: xxx}
   ✅ Hit shape: shape_id2 database  
   📐 Relative position: {relativeX: xx, relativeY: xx, w: 120, h: 80}
   🎯 Detected handle: left/right/top/bottom
   🔄 Current connection state: {isConnecting: true, sourceShapeId: "shape_id", sourceHandleId: "top"}
   🔗 Completing connection
   🔗 Creating arrow between shapes: {source: "shape_id:top", target: "shape_id2:left"}
   ✅ Found both shapes: {source: "compute", target: "database"}  
   ✅ Got transforms: {source: {...}, target: {...}}
   📐 Calculated positions: {source: {...}, target: {...}, delta: {...}}
   ✅ Successfully created arrow: [arrow object]
   🎯 Arrow connects shape_id:top → shape_id2:left
   ```

### Step 5: Test Cancellation
1. Start a connection
2. Click on empty canvas area
3. **Expected Console Output**:
   ```
   🎯 Pointer down in connect mode
   📍 Click point: {x: xxx, y: xxx}  
   ❌ No shape hit
   🚫 Cancelling connection
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### If No Console Output Appears:
- Check if Connect mode is actually enabled
- Verify browser console is showing all log levels
- Check if React StrictMode is causing double renders

### If Shape Detection Fails:
- Verify components are properly rendered with valid dimensions
- Check if click coordinates are being calculated correctly
- Ensure shapes have valid transform data

### If Arrow Creation Fails:
- Check browser console for arrow creation errors
- Verify tldraw version supports the arrow shape API used
- Check if arrow properties are valid for current tldraw version

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ Connect mode can be toggled on/off  
✅ Clicking component edges detects correct handle  
✅ Connection state transitions properly  
✅ Arrows are created and visible on canvas  
✅ Connection can be cancelled by clicking empty space  
✅ Multiple connections can be created  
✅ Debug logging provides clear feedback  

## 🚀 Key Improvements Made

1. **Stable Event Handling**: Fixed event listener lifecycle management
2. **Robust Shape Detection**: Manual bounds checking instead of unreliable API
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Full visibility into connection process  
4. **Better State Management**: Functional updates prevent stale closures
5. **Increased Handle Margins**: 30px margin for easier clicking
6. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with detailed error messages
