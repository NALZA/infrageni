# Infrageni

**Product Vision:** InfraGeni empowers developers, architects, and learners to visually design, understand, and provision cloud infrastructure with unprecedented ease and intelligence, bridging the gap between concept and code across multiple cloud providers.

**Core Principles & Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**

- **Visual-First Design:** Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for rapid system architecture creation.
- **Multi-Cloud Agnostic:** Seamlessly toggle between major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP initially) to design, compare, and understand provider-specific components.
- **Intelligent Automation (AI-Powered):** AI assists in optimizing designs, generating accurate Infrastructure as Code, and actively teaching systems design principles.
- **Learning & Development Focus:** Not just a design tool, but an educational platform for all levels of expertise.
- **Production-Ready Output:** Generate high-quality, deployable IaC files directly from visual designs.

**Key Things to Always Keep in Mind (Guiding Principles):**

1. **Cloud Provider Toggle (CORE):** The ability to switch between AWS, Azure, GCP (and future providers) _at any point_ in the design process is paramount. This should influence component selection, IaC generation, and AI recommendations.
2. **AI as an Intelligent Partner:** AI should be helpful, not intrusive. It should offer suggestions, validate designs, and teach, always with clear explanations and the user in control.
3. **Accuracy and Reliability:** Generated IaC must be syntactically correct and semantically meaningful for the chosen cloud provider and IaC tool.
4. **User Experience is King:** The drag-and-drop interface must be fluid, responsive, and visually appealing. Complex functionality should be accessible without overwhelming the user.
5. **Extensibility and Future-Proofing:** Design the architecture to easily integrate new cloud services, IaC providers, and AI models as they emerge.
6. **Educational Value:** Every feature, especially the AI, should contribute to the user's understanding and skill development in systems design.
