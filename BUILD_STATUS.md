#### 2. Enhanced Icon Registry (`icons-extended.tsx`)
- **50+ Icons**: Provider-specific SVG icons with gradients and branding
- **Size Variants**: xs, sm, md, lg, xl sizing options
- **Status States**: active, inactive, error, warning visual states
- **Fallback System**: Graceful fallback to generic icons

- `nx run infrageni:typecheck` - Type checking
- `nx run infrageni:lint` - Code linting
- `nx run infrageni:test` - Unit tests

### Implementation Status

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Extended component system with 28 components
- [x] Enhanced icon registry with 50+ icons
- [x] Advanced component library UI
- [x] Search and filtering functionality
- [x] Provider-specific pricing information

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Next Steps)
- [ ] Component templates and presets
- [ ] Drag and drop from library to canvas
- [ ] Component dependency validation
- [ ] Advanced search with tags
- [ ] Component usage analytics

#### Phase 3: Enterprise Features (Future)
- [ ] Custom component creation
- [ ] Component marketplace
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Advanced export formats
- [ ] Plugin system for third-party providers

### Next Steps

1. **Build Validation**: Run full build to ensure all components work together
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component library integration with main application
3. **Performance Testing**: Validate performance with large component libraries
4. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on enhanced component library UX

### Known Limitations

1. **Build Timeouts**: Build process may timeout due to large codebase
2. **Icon Loading**: Some provider icons may need optimization
3. **Search Performance**: Large component libraries may need search optimization
4. **Mobile UX**: Component library may need mobile-specific optimizations

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Run build validation and fix any remaining issues
2. **Short-term**: Implement drag-and-drop integration with main canvas
3. **Medium-term**: Add component templates and advanced search
4. **Long-term**: Implement enterprise features and plugin system
