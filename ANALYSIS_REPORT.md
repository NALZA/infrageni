**Comprehensive export capabilities**:
- **Mermaid**: C4 Context, Architecture (beta), Flowchart formats
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform generation
- **Vector Graphics**: SVG export with proper styling
- **Data Exchange**: JSON export with metadata

### 3. tldraw Integration ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Modern v3.13.1 integration** with custom shapes:
- Custom shape utilities for infrastructure components
- Proper drag-and-drop implementation
- Container hierarchy (VPC > Subnet > Resources)
- Arrow-based connection system

### 4. URL State Management ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Sophisticated state persistence**:
- LZ-string compression for efficient URLs
- Automatic state synchronization

- **Export Utils**: Tests for export functionality (need to verify implementation)
- **Hooks**: URL state management tests
- **Shapes**: Basic shape utility tests
- **E2E**: Playwright setup for end-to-end testing

### Test Quality: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Well-structured testing approach** with Vitest, React Testing Library, and Playwright integration.

## üöÄ Emerging Features

### Animation System (Implementation Ready)
**LinkedIn-style presentation capabilities**:
- Keyframe-based animation system
- Multiple easing options (linear, ease-in/out, bounce)
- Sequence management with loop support
- Configurable playback controls

### Diagram Library (Implementation Ready)
**Template and sharing system**:
- Template categorization (web-architecture, microservices, data-pipeline)
- Difficulty levels and estimated completion times
- Public/private diagram sharing
- Auto-save functionality with versioning

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues & Technical Debt

### 1. Arrow Binding System (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Export utilities use deprecated tldraw v2 API patterns
```typescript
// Current problematic code in export-utils.ts:28
const bindings = editor.getBindingsFromShape(shape.id, 'arrow');
```

**Impact**: 
- May cause export inconsistencies
- Deprecated API usage in v3
- Potential runtime errors

**Solution**: Migrate to tldraw v3 binding system
```typescript
// Should use: editor.getBindingsToShape(shape, 'arrow')
// And follow the 'fromId' property for arrow shape retrieval
```

### 2. Shape System Modernization (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Mixed custom shapes with fallback to note shapes
**Impact**: Inconsistent shape behavior, maintenance complexity
**Solution**: Complete migration to tldraw v3 custom shape pattern

### 3. Type Safety Improvements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Some `any` type usage in export utilities
**Locations**: 
- `export-utils.ts:39` - `const arrowProps = shape.props as any`
- `export-utils.ts:84` - `...(props as any)`

**Impact**: Runtime errors, reduced development experience
**Solution**: Implement proper TypeScript interfaces

### 4. Container Hierarchy Logic (LOW PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Manual bounding box calculations
**Opportunity**: Leverage tldraw's parent-child relationships
**Solution**: Use tldraw's built-in hierarchy system
